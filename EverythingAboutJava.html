    <div id="Java">
    <p class="What">
        <strong>Java</strong> is a high level, modern programming language designed in the early 1990s by Sun
        Microsystems, and is now currently owned by Oracle.<br>
        
        Java is platform-independent, which means that you only need to write the program once to be able to run it on a number of different platforms.<br>
        
        Java is portable, robust, and dynamic, with the ability to fit the needs of virtually any type of application.<br>
        
        Java is used to develop applications for Google's Android OS, various desktop applications, (such as media players and antivirus programs), web applications (such as interactive content), enterprise applications (i.e., banking), and many more. </p>
        <p class="help">Some key functions include:<br> </p>
      <p class="What">
<strong>Object Oriented</strong> -<br>
Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. 
Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior. 
Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules.

<p class="What"><strong>Simple</strong> -<br> 
    Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun Microsystem, Java language is a simple programming language because:
    
    Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).
    Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.</p>

    </p>
<p class="What"><strong>Secure</strong> -<br>
    Java provides a variety of salient features that are preferred by the developers. It is the reason that a billion of devices runs on Java.<br>
    
    Java is secure due to the following reasons:
    
    Java programs run inside a virtual machine which is known as a sandbox.<br>
<li>Java does not support explicit pointer.</li>
<li>Byte-code verifier checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access right to object.</li>
<li>It provides java.security package implements explicit security.</li>
<li>It provides library level safety.</li>
<li>Run-time security check takes place when we load new code.</li>
<li>Run-time security check takes place when we load new code.</li>
    <p class="What">These is only the tip of the iceberg on what makes Java so Secure.</p>
